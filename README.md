This project focuses on using HTML to create a recipe website with a brutalist design. The goal is to demonstrate the skills learned in HTML and showcase the ability to create a minimalist and raw website for sharing recipes.

Skills to be demonstrated in this project include:

- HTML markup for structuring the web pages
- Adding images and styling them with a brutalist aesthetic
- Implementing links
- Ensuring accessibility for users with disabilities

By completing this project, I will gain hands-on experience in web development and enhance my understanding of HTML. It will also provide me with a portfolio piece to showcase my skills to potential employers or clients.
